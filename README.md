# IceBreaker
Icebreaker: a dating preparation web application that prepares individuals for dating through virtual and simulated preparation questions and feedback. Made @ HackPrinceton 2017 ðŸ’‘ðŸ‘­ðŸ‘¬

## Inspiration
They say that what you say is not as important as how you say it. This seems to ring true especially when it comes to dating, where unconscious subtleties such as fidgeting, tone of voice, or using too many filler words, can mean the difference between a failed date and securing a second one. We noticed there are many speech and facial analyzers but no dating websites that incorporate them to help their clients asses their areas of weakness.

## What it does

Icebreaker is a web appliction that analyzes a candidate by putting them through simulated date-like questions and analyzing their performance with analytics and feedback to improve. 

## How I built it

## Challenges I ran into
In terms of front-end design, one of the challenges that we ran into was adding CSS PreProcessors into the documentation. Using anatomic design structure we tried to organize the code with SASS tools to streamline development process. Overall, we had never integrated facial recognition using Microsoft Azure with a web application so that was a hurdle that we overcame. 

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
We're proud of the fac that the project had the ability to detect emotions, posture, and speech time/semantics and develop analytics that would improve the candidate's likeability during dates. This real-time data would be able to help candidates that find dating difficult.  

## What I learned
We learned how to integrate facial recognition, and semantics analytics into a web application. 

## What's next for IceBreaker
It would be quite interesting to allow the user to give us feedback after his/her date. This would allow us to tweak our algorithm to prioritize certain characteristics over others and look for new ones. As well, improving upon the user learning experience through progress checks, historical analysis, etc, would position us as a major provider of dating service. We truly believe that ultimately this company would either be acquired by eHarmony (the largest dating service that currently uses the most scientific method of matching individuals) or we would be a large competitor of theirs and a leader in dating preparation using vocal and body language analysis.
